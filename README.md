This is my code, mostly for personal use but I want to explain it better.

ArucoRWMulti.  This code finds a real-world pose from multiple Aruco Markers.  It is a work in progress. It is mostly taken from several blogs.  First, Automatic Addison helped me with the rotation matrix code.  
The biggest new development is the transformation from camera coords into real world coords.  This was provided by OutOfTheBOTS on Youtube.  I will put links in here later.
It is currently written in OpenCV 4.10. 
To do: 
- I have to adapt it back to OpenCV 4.6 because that is what's used on my Jetson AGX Xavier.
- I have to find a single pose for the camera instead of separate ones generated by each marker.
- To use this file you have to measure the distance in X and Y between each of your Aruco Tags.

ArucoRealSense.  This is simple marker detection code, but adapted from the classic OpenCV cap.read() format for the RealSense camera, which has a separate initialization procedure.
So far I have only been able to analyze the flat images from the 2D camera included with the RealSense, 
I hope soon to learn more about semantic segmentation of point cloud data.

The RSCalChessboard file is just to calibrate the RealSense camera.
